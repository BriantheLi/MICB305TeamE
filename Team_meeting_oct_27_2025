More limitations:
IBD nucleotides for forward and reverse will be different
Forward = 246 and reverse = 190
For alcohol: all 250 for both forward and reverse
citations: APA? In tect citation = numbers or author names & year?
Alcohol primer has different lengths, is that matter?
For the discussion on what has been published previously on our dataset and our research topic, do we mainly focus on the articles on Canvas that have our datasets?
