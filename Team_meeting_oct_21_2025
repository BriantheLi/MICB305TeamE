Introduction and Background
Background Knowledge
Importance of research into this subject - potential applications 
Knowledge gap/limitation
A lot of papers look at microbes and functional data within digestive tracts, but tend to focus more on the physical functions of the digestive systems themselves rather than the microbiome functions
How we will address the knowledge gap
Hypothesis: 


Research question:
What are the microbial functional differences between IBD patients and people who drink high amounts of alcohol?
How does the gut microbiome’s functional composition change when comparing IBD patients with people who drink alcohol
Choose alcohol because it also affects gut microbiome but we haven’t yet known how significant the differences are compared to those who have IBD.
Picrust pipeline → pull functional classifications, and compare IBD to alcohol
Age (Both data)
Gender (Both)
Alcohol consumption per gram per day
Filter the site of specimen/biosp (IBD)
Filter medication (IBD)
Non-smoker (if we have enough samples, IBD)
Keep all inflammatory tissue and non-inflammatory tissue
From IBD set: healthy serves as control for both IBD and alcohol
From alcohol set: Low alcohol consumption can also work as a control functional group
Low alcohol consumption 

Experimental Aims and Rationale

Proposed Approach (layout of what we will be doing throughout the term to achieve the aims - we should also include a timeline for achievements of each stage of the project. Like data wrangling, data analysis, etc.)



Coding:
Pull the both metadata
Keep the column names for the IBD set (the same as in Canvas)
Filter the site of specimen/biopsy (IBD) (Keep on the right colon and right colon undefined)
Filter medication (IBD- No medication) (If not enough, all medications in)
Non-smoker (if we have enough samples, IBD)
Run DADA2 (For both data separately)
Run the quality plot (For both data separately)
Rarefaction depth (For both data separately)
Remove the species column for the alcohol
Create a new column for alcohol:
For women: Consuming 25 grams or more of alcohol per day. 
For men: Consuming 45 grams or more of alcohol per day.
Create a new column for age:
Greater or equal than 60: Seniors
Equal 20- not equal 60: adult
Less than 20: Child (not found in IBD set)
Combine both data (Fill the column with no value with NA like alcohol consumption, in other words, values from the other datasets that are not in the original one)

Find papers on microbes and functional data within digestive tracts, but tend to focus more on the physical functions of the digestive systems themselves rather than the microbiome functions. Physical functions of digestive systems in IBD patients and those consuming alcohol

For ryan data:
ryan_ibd_data_filtered = ryan_ibd_data |>
  filter(Biopsy_location == "Right colon" | Biopsy_location == "Right colon undefined") |>
  filter(Medications == 'No')
This one has 37 samples but no smoking status: 22 male and 15 female

ryan_ibd_data_filtered = ryan_ibd_data |>
  filter(Medications == 'No')
this one has 78 samples but no specific biopsy location and smoking status: 44 males and 38 females

ryan_ibd_data_filtered = ryan_ibd_data |>
  filter(Medications == 'No') |>
  filter(Smoking.status == 'Non-smoker')
This one has 66 samples but no specific biopsy location: 42 males and 24 females

ryan_ibd_data_filtered = ryan_ibd_data |>
  filter(Biopsy_location == "Right colon" | Biopsy_location == "Right colon undefined")
This one has 137 samples but no smoking and medicine status: 76 males and 61 females.

ryan_ibd_data_filtered = ryan_ibd_data |>
  filter(Biopsy_location == "Right colon" | Biopsy_location == "Right colon undefined") |>
  filter(Smoking.status == 'Non-smoker') |>
  filter(Medications == 'No' | Medications == "")
47 samples: 27 Males and 20 Females
We would go with this one.

For alcohol:
Most of the samples are in low comsumpsution of alcohol.
Remove one row of data since it is missing gender, alcohol, and age.
