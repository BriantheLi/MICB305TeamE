Todo/Agenda for Meeting Today:
Ask about the code to extract the dataset from the server
Keep thinking about how are we going to find the function of the organisms based on 16s
Where to start with project proposal?
- Once our research question is obtained, should we begin with data analysis right away or split between writing up the background/introduction and finding references that way?
- Look at previous 475 workflow timelines of other groups that have completed their term projects

Regarding our research question and resources
- How should we compile our sources? I currently use Zotero... so should I just share the library as we continue forward with literature review?
Alcohol dataset:
-Remove the species
-Maybe separate based on gender or not
-Classify based on age??? as we know that age can affect our gut microbiome
IBD dataset:
Wrangling of variables, which ones could be clinically relevant?
-Smoking - very briefly mentioned in the paper regarding epigenetic effects - carcinogen maybe?
-Any idea on what the merge column means in the dataset?
-Biopsy location
-The data appears to be sometimes have been taken in pairs and sometimes not...
-Tissue inflammation
-Medication taken and types - anti inflammatory and mercatopurine (autoimmune diseases)?
-Type of infection
-What is Montreal classification?

Relevant resources for project proposal, probably start building our reference list now so we aren't in a rush later down the line.

My understand og high consumption of alcohol is that it would greatly affect ones health.
But not sure if this apply to all age.
High consumption of alcohol:
For women: Consuming 25 grams or more of alcohol per day. 
For men: Consuming 45 grams or more of alcohol per day.

General effects of alcohol on the human body could be laid as groundwork regarding relevance in a research question for our proposal.

For example, this article on alcohol's overall effects as a carcinogen on the human body. 
It also mentions the gut microbiome and potential functions of the bacteria that we could look into, especially their roles in producing acetaldehyde 
(not relevant to IBD, but useful nonetheless, could run this by Sam/Avril)
