Limitation: 
1 fecal and 1 biopsy; only one female in the high alcohol consumption level.
Picrust pipeline → pull functional classifications, and compare IBD to alcohol
Beta-diversity analysis
Age (Both data)
Gender (Both)
Alcohol consumption per gram per day
Filter medication (IBD)
Non-smoker (if we have enough samples, IBD)
Keep all inflammatory tissue and non-inflammatory tissue
Only considered health patients in IBD as our control
From IBD set: healthy serves as control for both IBD and alcohol (separate based on genders and age groups)

Proposed Approach (layout of what we will be doing throughout the term to achieve the aims - we should also include a timeline for achievements of each stage of the project. Like data wrangling, data analysis, etc.)

Look into merging of both 16S sequences - different lengths between two datasets but we want to somehow do a phylogenetic comparison - doable even with different lengths between the sets?
Datasets are 16S V3-V4 rRNA sequence locations as well - is it possible to do a beta comparison with phylogeny factored in then?


Meeting Minutes Nov-4-2025
- 16S rRNA V3-V4 genome data can be merged (hopefully without issue)
    - Data should match up hopefully even if the nucleotides are different lengths between datasets
    - Should still trim to one of the datasets’ parameters for consistency —> whichever is more important maybe??

- List limitations just in discussion or “limitations” section of the manuscript when we fully write it - should compile all limitations somewhere or on just Github

- Proposal introduction vs manuscript introduction
    - Manuscript should be answering the research question by the stage of research conclusion
    - Already know the findings 
    - Final paragraph should flow within the intro

- Further data wrangling = column denoting which points are from which dataset

- Splitting IBD groups —> could split up UC and CD if they are significantly different from each other and compare both groups to high alcohol intake patients
    - Run beta diversity analyses for UC and CD vs alcohol
        - If beta diversity is same - pick the shared bacterial groups for piecrust
            - See what common pathways both alcohol and (IBD condition) work under
        - If diversity is different - pick the odd ones out for piecrust functional analysis
            - See what pathway is unique and how else the disease can be treated that is not similar to the conditions 

- Analyses that we need to do:
    - Beta analysis —> Picrust 
    - Abundance

- Manuscript deadline is December 14 —> final manuscript will be marked based on how well we improve based on feedback asw

- Future directions: 
    - Sampling locations paired in patients processing based pairwise and inspecting the microbiomes within the subject based on sampling location
