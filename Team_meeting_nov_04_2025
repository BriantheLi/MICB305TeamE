Limitation: 
1 fecal and 1 biopsy; only one female in the high alcohol consumption level.
Picrust pipeline → pull functional classifications, and compare IBD to alcohol
Beta-diversity analysis
Age (Both data)
Gender (Both)
Alcohol consumption per gram per day
Filter medication (IBD)
Non-smoker (if we have enough samples, IBD)
Keep all inflammatory tissue and non-inflammatory tissue
Only considered health patients in IBD as our control
From IBD set: healthy serves as control for both IBD and alcohol (separate based on genders and age groups)

Proposed Approach (layout of what we will be doing throughout the term to achieve the aims - we should also include a timeline for achievements of each stage of the project. Like data wrangling, data analysis, etc.)
