I have no question from Billy
We'll wait until Brian showed Dr. Sun and Dr. Avril the graphs/plots then see how we can proceed

alcohol cohort:
- faith: not significant 
- evenness: not significant
- only 5 low samples for bray-curtis
- unweighted: no clustering

IBD cohort:
- bray-Curtis: clusters - does have effect
- evenness - non-significant
- colon may have more diverse microbiomes than small intestine
+ crohn has more profile, 
- beta diversity has no significance

core microbiome 
- 3 way comparison
- 2 way picrust

Figure 1. panel A. alpha diversity Shannon alcohol vs non-alcohol
panel B. alpha Shannon ibd vs healthy (IBD sep into UC and CD)
panel C: jaccard alcohol
panel D. jaccard for IBD
need to do statistical tests to ensure they're significant (PERMANOVA)
