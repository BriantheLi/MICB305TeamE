Meeting 2
Paper doesn’t do the functional analysis of the microbes themselves
Picrust useful here?
Functional data is present but is prioritized intestinal walls of the host
Look at the microbiome reaction —> functional analysis
What functions present for the host vs what functions present on the microbiome
Intestinal metabolites - from the host and the bacteria
Multiomics
16S —> functional —> relate to the observed metabolites present
FMT comparison cohort
Phenotypes of the IBD group == Phenotype of the Alcohol group
Functional analysis

Proposal —> write up and justify
Keep everything simple
Beta diversity plot

Make sure that we know what the data is —>

Alcohol consumption - clinically high volumes should be noted

Look at the Ryan set
